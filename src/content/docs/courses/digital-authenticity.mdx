### The Problem We're Solving

The proliferation of AI-generated content has created unprecedented challenges for trust in digital media:

  <div class="key-concept-content">
    <h4>The Authenticity Crisis</h4>
    <p>Studies show that people can only identify AI-generated images correctly about 50% of the time — no better than random chance. This has profound implications for journalism, legal evidence, and public discourse.</p>

    <h4>The Solution: Content Credentials</h4>
    <p>Content credentials provide cryptographically signed metadata that travels with digital content, proving its origin, who created it, and any modifications made along the way.</p>

## Module 2: Understanding C2PA

The **Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA)** is an industry consortium that has developed open technical standards for certifying the provenance and history of media content.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="What is C2PA?">
    C2PA is a technical specification that defines how to:
    
    - **Bind** cryptographic signatures to media files
    - **Record** the history of content creation and modification
    - **Verify** the authenticity and provenance of content
    - **Display** credential information to end users
    
    Major supporters include Adobe, Microsoft, Intel, BBC, and many others.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="How It Works">
    Content credentials work through a chain of trust:
    
    1. **Creation**: When content is created, the device or software embeds signed metadata
    2. **Modification**: Any edits are recorded as new "assertions" in the credential
    3. **Distribution**: The credentials travel with the content
    4. **Verification**: Anyone can verify the credential chain using public keys
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="What's Included">
    A C2PA manifest typically contains:
    
    - **Creator information**: Who made the content
    - **Creation method**: Camera capture, AI generation, composite, etc.
    - **Timestamp**: When it was created
    - **Modification history**: What changes were made
    - **Ingredients**: Any source materials used
    - **Digital signature**: Cryptographic proof of authenticity
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

<Aside type="tip" title="Pro Tip">
  When evaluating content with credentials, pay attention to the entire chain of custody — not just who created it, but how it has been modified and by whom.
</Aside>

## Module 3: Real-World Applications

### Use Cases

Digital authenticity and content credentials have applications across many domains:

| Domain | Application | Impact |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| **Journalism** | Verify photos and videos for news stories | Reduce misinformation |
| **Legal** | Establish chain of custody for digital evidence | Admissible in court |
| **Marketing** | Prove authenticity of product images | Consumer trust |
| **Art & NFTs** | Verify original creation and ownership | Protect creators |
| **Social Media** | Label AI-generated content | Informed users |

### Case Study: News Photography

Consider a photojournalist covering a breaking news event:

1. **Capture**: Camera embeds C2PA credentials at moment of capture
2. **Edit**: Photo editor crops and adjusts exposure; changes are logged
3. **Publish**: News organization adds their credential to the chain
4. **Verify**: Readers can verify the entire history with one click

<Aside type="caution">
  Content credentials don't guarantee that content is *true* — they verify that it was created by who claims to have created it and hasn't been tampered with. A verified photo could still be deliberately misleading through framing or context.
</Aside>

## Module 5: Getting Started with Verification

### Tools for Verifying Content Credentials

Several tools are available for verifying C2PA content credentials:

1. **Content Authenticity Initiative Verify** — Web-based tool at verify.contentauthenticity.org
2. **A10city Verify** — Our own verification tool at a10city.com/verify
3. **Browser Extensions** — Check content as you browse
4. **Command-line tools** — For developers and advanced users

### Try It Yourself

<Aside type="tip" title="Exercise">
  Visit [verify.contentauthenticity.org](https://verify.contentauthenticity.org) and upload an image from a credentialed source (like recent Adobe Stock images) to see how content credentials are displayed.
